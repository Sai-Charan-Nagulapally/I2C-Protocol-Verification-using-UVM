Designed and implemented a Verilog HDL model of an I2C memory controller, supporting both read and write transactions according to the I2C protocol. This involved designing the core logic for I2C communication, including start/stop conditions, address and data transfer, and acknowledge handling.

Developed UVM-based verification environment for the I2C memory controller. This included the creation of constrained random transactions, sequences for read/write/reset operations, a protocol monitor, and a scoreboard for data integrity checks.
